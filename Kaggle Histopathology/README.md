## Histopathology Cancer Detection

This is my submission for the Kaggle challenge [Histopathology Cancer Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/histopathologic-cancer-detection/)

## Setup

Make sure that the Kaggle API has been setup. Instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/kaggle/Kaggle-API).

The Kaggle API makes it really simple to download all data related to a challenge, or any other datasets hosted on Kaggle. Once it's been setup, download the data for the challenge by running the following commands
    
    bash data_prep.sh
    
The command above will download the data, unzip it and setup a directory structure that the neural network can use. This command should take anywhere from a couple minutes to 10-15 minutes, depending on the speed of your internet connection and your computer. Go grab a coffee while you wait.
