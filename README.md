# Model Zoo

Repo containing implementations of pretrained networks on various datasets found on Kaggle

To follow and to replicate, you'll need to have a conda/virtualenv setup, with PyTorch >= 0.4, fastai >= 1.0 and all other dependencies. Most of the notebooks utilize the [fast.ai](https://fast.ai) library for fast training, and have then been converted to PyTorch models and served up as Heroku web apps

## Kaggle setup

To start, setup the Kaggle CLI according to the instructions described [here](https://github.com/kaggle/kaggle-api). This should let you download the datasets with ease.
